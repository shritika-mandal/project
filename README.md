Login Form Project

Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
2. Extract the files to a directory on your local machine.
3. Open the directory in a code editor or IDE.

Running the Project

1. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the login form.
2. Enter a username and password in the form fields.
3. Click the "Submit" button to simulate a login attempt.
4. The form will validate the input fields and display an error message if necessary.
5. If the input is valid, the form will send a POST request to the API endpoint (currently set to `(link unavailable)).
6. The API response will be displayed on the page.

Development Environment

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are located in the src directory.
- CSS styles are defined in style.css.
- JavaScript code is in script.js.
- API endpoint is currently set to `(link unavailable) (a dummy API for testing purposes).

Notes

- This project uses a simple HTML form, CSS styling, and JavaScript for client-side validation and API integration.
- The API endpoint is currently a dummy endpoint for testing purposes. You should replace this with your own API endpoint in a production environment.
